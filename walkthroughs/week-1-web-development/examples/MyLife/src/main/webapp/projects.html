      <h1>RoboCup Jr Rescue Maze</h1>
      <p> Contributed to the creation of a fully autonomous robot capable of searching through a maze for victims by developing
          a control algorithm to ensure the precise movement and correct performance of the robot based on an Arduino
          microcontroller board. Worked with C++, Git, Data redundancy, PID, ultrasonic, TCS and BNO sensors.
